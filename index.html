	<h1>FIVE G<br>Gamify School and Make Learning Fun!</h1>
	<div id="main">
		<div>
			<h2>What is Five G?</h2>
      <p>We noticed that the current generation spends hours watching videos and playing games, but they feel bad for not earning anything from it. <br> What better solution than to combine fun with learning, we thought. That's why we decided to come together to create a way to earn monthly prizes by playing and watching videos!   
</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Competitions</h2>
      <p>Every month we have two competitions, with one group for each.<br> <img class='pics' src="images/trophy.png">At the end of the term of each competition, the coronation is announced, being informed on social networks who won, in addition to the award ceremony.<br> To enter a competition it is necessary to pay an entry fee. Each registration is only valid for one competition of the month.<br> The winner of each group will be the one who gets the highest amount of Magic Power points, acquired only through correct questions. Hitting questions in a row generates combo points, resulting in more Spell Power. <br> At the beginning of each competition there is a minimum and limited amount of questions, with more being added every 3 days until the last day of each competition.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		  <h2>Dates</h2>
			<img class='pics' src="images/calendar.png">
		  <p>Each of the competitions begin on the 16th of the month, and hence end on the t15th. Mark your calendars and prepare for a month of hard work to earn some fantastic awards! Find out more about them in the next section...</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Awards</h2>
      <p>Each competition closes after 28 days. On the 28th day, the  winner is announced and crowned King or Queen of that month and receives their award.<br>In a competition, the winner will be the one who has the highest amount of Magic Power. Tiebreakers will be made by highest character Level, combo value or in a Level competition.<br>Awards will be in cash, gift cards or gamer accessories.</p>
		</div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>   When the player does not know a question, he can click on the "Search" button to look for information or search the internet about the subject.
       It is not allowed to deliver the answers or seek the answers with another player. The research is there for you to discover for yourself.
<br>
       The player who wins the competition, after the announcement on social networks, must send a private message on Instagram to receive their award. After the announcement, if 7 days pass without contacting you, on the 8th day the award will be lost and it will not be possible to redeem it.
<br>
       The purchase of a registration only entitles you to compete in it, not valid for others and being necessary to purchase if you want to participate in other competitions.</p>
